<h2>About this Chrome extension</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.eexcess.eu" target="_blank"><img src="/media/EEXCESS__Logo_RGB.png"/></a> is a research project
    funded by the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 600601.
    Its vision is to unfold the treasure of cultural, educational and scientific long-tail content for the benefit of
    all users.
    EEXCESS stands for: Enhancing Europe’s eXchange in Cultural Educational and Scientific reSources.
</p>

<h3> Research objectives:</h3>

<p>
    Through personalised and contextualised recommendation technologies we aim to enrich existing content dissemination
    channels users habitually use (e.g. social media) and content creation techniques users regularly conduct (e.g.
    writing blog entries). In order to ensure high quality recommendations we emphasize the integration of knowledge
    from memory organisations as well as the analysis of user behaviour and content consumption patterns. As the latter
    raises serious privacy protection issues, we will develop methods for retaining users’ privacy while offering the
    full range of personalisation.

<h3><a name="question1"></a>What is EEXCESS?</h3>

<p>
    The main goal of EEXCESS is to facilitate the access to high-quality information on the internet. In this sense it
    will research and develop personalised, contextualised and decentralised recommendation technology capable to scale
    to large numbers of users. This is done by the enrichment of media content, creation of personalised recommendations
    as well as privacy preservation.

<h3><a name="question2"></a>How do I use the search function?</h3>

<p>
    There are three different ways to get search results. The first one: In the upper left corner of the plug-in you can
    find the search box. After entering your keyword(s), press the search button or simply hit the enter key. In the
    field below there will appear the results provided by either mendeley.com europeana.eu or econbiz.de.
    Secondly, every time a new browser window or a new tab is opened or a page is reloaded, a corresponding query
    will be automatically generated. As soon as results are available, the number of retrieved results is indicated at the EEXCESS icon in the menu bar. Clicking it displays the results and the corresponding query terms in the search box.
    A third way to get results is by selecting relevant parts of a text. Again, the number of results is indicated at the icon after retrieving them and clicking the icon will show the results.

<h3><a name="question3"></a>How can I explore my results?</h3>

<p>
    Push the first button on the right side of the search field <img src="/media/batchmaster/grid.png"
                                                                     alt="FacetScape Icon"/>. The facet scape helps you
    to visualize and arrange your results. The results are now divided in specific descriptive features, e.g. provider,
    language, year etc. To each feature, the available instances are shown. In this visual search interface you can
    filter, specify or refine your results according to your request. All instances of a feature, such “de” for
    languages, serves as a filter for the given result set. While hovering over a specific instance, numbers in the top
    right corner indicate how much search results are specified by it and how the size of the filtered result set will
    change.

<h3><a name="question4"></a>Can I get my results visualized other than a list?</h3>

<p>
    The third button on the right of the search field <img src="/media/batchmaster/timeline.png" alt="Timeline icon"/>
    enables you to display your results in a timeline or in a bar chart . It is an interactive visualisation, where you
    can filter and arrange your results by time, language, year or provider.

<h3><a name="question5"></a>Where do I find my profile and how can I change it?</h3>

                                                                      alt="profile settings icon"/> you can edit your
    profile page. The user profile is divided in Identity (Name, Address), Demographics (gender, birth date) and Topics
    of Interest. Fill in your data and close the window. Changes are being saved
    accordingly.
