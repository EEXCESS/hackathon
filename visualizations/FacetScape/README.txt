= This is a prototypal implementation of the 'FacetScape' visualization
=
=
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
=
=
=	This prototype was mainly developed to run in Google Chrome.
=	
=	In order for the visualization to run properly you may need to
=	start an instance of Chrome Browser with the Same Origin Policy
=	disabled.
=	
=	1. Close all instances of Google Chrome
=	2. Start an instance with the parameter '--disable-web-security'
=	   (Therefor, open a terminal/console and navigate to the 
=	    installation directory of your Chrome Browser. 
=	    Now type in the appropriate command for your OS.) 
=
=
=	   WINDOWS
=
=	   chrome.exe --disable-web-security
=
=	   MAC
=
=	   $ open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security
=
=	   LINUX
=
=	   $ google-chrome --disable-web-security
=
=	3. A window of the Chrome browser should appear. Now you can
=	   open the 'index.html' file in that browser instance and 
=	   hopefully you see 'FacetScape'.
